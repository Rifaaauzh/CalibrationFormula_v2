## Calibration Formula

This repository contains the source code for Calibration Formula with the resistance of 100K.

## Introduction

Calibration is the process of adjusting the output or measurement of an instrument to align with a known standard.

## Formula

**ðŸ—’Formula 1 : Rdut Formula**

{Rdut} = {R2*(Vin - Vref)/(Vref - Vout)} 

Where:
- **Rdut**: The calibrated resistance of the device under test.
- **R2**: A known reference resistor.
- **Vin**: Input voltage.
- **Vref**: Reference voltage.
- **Vout**: Output voltage.

Parameters:
- **R2**: 100K ohms
- **Vin**: 12.0 volts
- **Vref**: 3.0 volts

**ðŸ—’Formula 2 : Adjusting Measured Voltage**

This formula is to adjusting voltage measured by device to be close with the value that was calculated using Formula 1.
$\[ y = 0.9531x + 0.1642 ]\$
 
Where:
- **y**: Calculated Value
- **x**: Measured Value

**ðŸ—’Formula 3: Tangent Value of the Graph**

This formula is for the tangent line for the graph of calculated voltage. The aim of the tangent line is to make a formula that will produce the voltage by Rdut value and will be close to the calculated value.

- **Low-Tangent Formula**
  This is the tangent value when resistor is less than 1 Million.
  y = 2.25 * 10^-6 - 0.15

- **Middle-Tangent Formula**
  This is the tangent value when resistor is between 1 Millon and 10 Million.
  y = 9 * 10^-8 + 2.37

- **High-Tangent Formula**
  This is the tangent value when resistor is less than 10 Million.
  y = 1.8 * 10^-9 + 2.892
